## üîß Reply Modes

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `ALL` | Reply to all discovered tweets | Maximum engagement |

| `NONE` | Collect tweets but don't reply | Data gathering only |

## üÜï Latest Improvements

### üß† **Smart Scrolling System**
- **Intelligent stopping**: Configurable `NO_NEW_TWEETS_SCROLL` prevents endless scrolling
- **Real-time extraction**: Saves tweets immediately to prevent DOM re-rendering loss
- **Progress tracking**: Detailed logging shows exactly what's being discovered and saved

### ü§ñ **Advanced AI Reply Engine**
- **Zero truncation**: AI generates complete responses under the character limit (no more "...")
- **Retry mechanism**: Automatically regenerates replies that are too long
- **Human-like tone**: Enhanced prompts ensure natural, authentic responses

### üõ†Ô∏è **Bulletproof Posting**
- **Autocomplete handling**: Automatically closes hashtag/mention suggestion dialogs
- **Verification system**: Confirms replies were actually posted successfully  
- **Smart recovery**: Automatic retry with additional cleanup if first attempt fails

### üìä **Enhanced Data Tracking**
- **Precise timestamps**: Extracts full ISO datetime from Twitter (e.g., "2025-06-05T12:01:25.000Z")
- **Video detection**: Accurately identifies tweets with video content
- **Duplicate prevention**: Robust database constraints prevent processing the same tweet twice

## üé® AI Customization

### Advanced Reply Generation
The bot now features **intelligent reply generation** that:
- ‚úÖ **Never truncates replies** - Uses retry logic instead of adding "..."
- ‚úÖ **Handles hashtags/mentions** - Automatically closes Twitter autocomplete dialogs
- ‚úÖ **Verifies successful posting** - Confirms replies were actually sent
- ‚úÖ **Natural human-like tone** - Sounds like a real person, not a bot

### Customizing AI Personality
Set `REPLY_INSTRUCTIONS` in your `.env` for complete control:

```env
# Example: Tech enthusiast
REPLY_INSTRUCTIONS="You are a tech enthusiast who loves discussing AI and programming. Be helpful, concise, and use relevant emojis. Always add value to the conversation. Write complete responses under 280 characters."

# Example: Friendly community member  
REPLY_INSTRUCTIONS="You are a friendly and supportive community member. Offer encouragement and share personal insights. Be authentic and conversational. Use emojis naturally but sparingly."

# Example: Industry expert
REPLY_INSTRUCTIONS="You are a knowledgeable industry expert. Provide thoughtful analysis and helpful resources. Be professional yet approachable. Focus on adding real value to discussions."
```

## üìä Database Schema

The bot uses SQLite to track tweets and prevent duplicates:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tweets (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    posted_at DATETIME,                    -- Precise ISO timestamp from Twitter
    tweet_id TEXT UNIQUE,                  -- Prevents duplicate processing
    user_id TEXT,                          -- Extracted from tweet metadata
    username TEXT,                         -- Twitter handle
    tweet_text TEXT,                       -- Full tweet content
    search_keyword TEXT,                   -- Hashtag/keyword used to find tweet
    video BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,               -- True if tweet contains video
    replied BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,             -- True if we've replied to this tweet
    reply_text TEXT                        -- Our AI-generated reply content
);
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Adding New Features
1. Core logic: Edit `index.js`
2. AI improvements: Modify `src/replyAgent.js`
3. Tweet extraction: Update `src/utils.js`

### Testing
```bash
# Test with dry run (no actual replies)
ENABLE_REPLIES=false node index.js

# Test AI reply generation
node -e "import ReplyAgent from './src/replyAgent.js'; const agent = new ReplyAgent(); console.log(await agent.generateReply({tweet_text: 'Hello world!', username: 'test'}));"
```

## üö® Important Notes

### Rate Limits & Best Practices
- Twitter has rate limits - don't run too frequently (30+ min intervals recommended)
- Use `SLOW_MO` to add delays between actions (1000ms+ recommended)
- Configure `NO_NEW_TWEETS_SCROLL` to avoid infinite scrolling
- Set `MAX_TWEETS_PER_RUN` to limit processing load
- Monitor your account for any restrictions
- Be respectful and add genuine value with replies
- Use `DELAY_BETWEEN_TWEETS` to pace your replies appropriately

### Security
- Never commit your `.env` file
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Consider using Twitter API v2 for production use
- Run in `HEADLESS=true` mode for production
